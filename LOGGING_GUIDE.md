## 🐛 Debugging Common Issues

### 1. Form Validation Errors
- **Frontend**: Check browser console for validation details
- **Look for**: `❌ Form validation failed` with specific field errors
- **Common**: Message too short (needs 10+ characters)

### 2. Email Sending Failures
- **Backend**: Check server terminal for email errors
- **Look for**: `❌ Failed to send email` with error details
- **Common**: SMTP configuration issues, invalid credentials

### 3. Network Connection Issues
- **Frontend**: Check for network error messages
- **Backend**: Verify server is running on correct port
- **Test**: Use `curl http://localhost:5000/health` to test connectivity

## 🛠️ Testing the Logging System

### Quick Test Script
```bash
# From the backend directory

```

### Manual Test
```bash

  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com", 
    "message": "This is a test message with enough characters to pass validation."
  }'
```
